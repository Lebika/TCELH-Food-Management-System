# TCELH-Food-Management-System
This system provides solution for managing food counts and leave schedules in ladies hostels: Thirunagar Hostel, Main Hostel, and New Hostel. Our primary goal is to minimize food wastage by accurately tracking the number of students present in the hostel and adjusting food preparation accordingly.
